## Fact Checker Skill / App

Fact Checker is a hobby project and is only maintained by me (the only developer so far).

The App should make it possible to query the [Google Fact Checker API](https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/apis) via Alexa or Google Nest / Home.

### Stack

The app is developed with the Jovo Framework. I use the TypeScrip variant.

To learn more about Jovo, please find the [Getting Started Guide](https://www.jovo.tech/framework/docs/installation) in the Jovo Framework Docs.


### Run the Code

```sh
# Compile Typescript
$ npm tsc

# Run Jovo development server (./dist/index.js)
$ jovo run
```
